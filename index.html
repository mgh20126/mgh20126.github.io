					<TH> Trailer Park Boys </TH>
						<TD> This show is my number one favorite. Its filled with dumb humor and has a repetitive story line but somehow is always entertaining. The characters are so dumb and are so funny. Ricky is my favorite character by far. He hates authority and loves chicken fingers and dope. Julian is great, too. He's the responsible one of the trio and often is the one with the best ideas. Bubbles is the underappreciated side kick. His love for following the law and kitties is often overlooked when he's hanging with Ricky and Julian.</TD>

					<TH> Parks and Recreation </TH>
							<TD>Parks and Rec is great because of its powerful female lead. She shows nonstop dedication to her job and sets a good example for people in her town of Pawnee Indiana. This show is full of silly humor and outrageous senarios that the town's government gets involved in. Each of the characters bring an interesting and funny element to the show that makes it overall super entertaining to watch.</TD>

					<TH> Rick and Morty (hulu) </TH>
						<TD>Rick is a super smart futuristic scientisit who enlists the help of his grandson Morty. Together the get involved in the most far fetched astronomical conundrums that always have a hint of dark humor. FOr this reason I love this show. Whenever i feel like "exapanding my mind" I go to Hulu and binge watch this show. Its so funny and to its critics I say 'You are wrong, Rick and Morty is the best show ever.'</TD>
